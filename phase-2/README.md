# Phase 2 – Multi-Agent System using Semantic Kernel 

## Overview

This project implements a **multi-agent system using Semantic Kernel (SK) in Python**.  
It demonstrates **agent orchestration**, **tool calling**, **event-driven design**, and **external system integration (MCP)**, while reusing a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline from Phase 1.

The system enables a manager to interact in natural language to:
- Create and update tasks
- List pending tasks for a user
- Ask company policy / knowledge questions
- Automatically trigger Slack notifications when tasks are created or updated

The implementation follows **clean architecture**, **Google Python Style Guide**, and **production-ready project structure**.
